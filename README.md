# Healthcare-data-cleansing-NLP

## Project Overview
This project focuses on automating the data cleansing process in healthcare records using Natural Language Processing (NLP). By leveraging NLP techniques, we aim to enhance the quality, consistency, and accuracy of healthcare data, ensuring it is suitable for further analysis and machine learning applications.

## Dataset
Name: healthcare_dataset.csv

Source : Kaggle

Description: The dataset consists of healthcare records with various inconsistencies such as missing values, duplicate entries, and incorrect formats. It is used to train and evaluate our NLP-based data cleansing model.


## Training Notebook
Notebook Name: NLP.ipynb

Details: The dataset has been preprocessed, trained, and evaluated in the Jupyter Notebook NLP.ipynb. 

The notebook contains:
Data loading and preprocessing steps

NLP-based cleansing techniques

Model training and validation

Performance analysis and results
